/*Q .One of the applications of computers in numerical analysis is computing the area under 
     a curve.One simple method of calculating the area under a curve is to divide the area 
     into a number of trapezoids of same width and summing up the area into a number of 
     trapezoids of same width and summing up the area of individual trapezoids. The area 
     of a trapezoid is given by â€“ 
     Area = 0.5*(h1 + h2)*b
     where h1 and h2 are the heights of two sides and b is the width as shown in fig. below.
Write a C Program to calculate the area for a curve of the function f(x) = x2 + 1 between any 
two given limits say A and B as shown in figure above.
Hint: Inputs to the program are lower limit(A), upper limit(B) and the number of trapezoids
