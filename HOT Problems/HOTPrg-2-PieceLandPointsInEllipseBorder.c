/*Q. You are given an elliptical-shaped land and you are asked to choose n arbitrary points on its boundary. 
Then you connect each point with every other point using straight lines, forming n(n â€“ 1)/2 connections. 
What is the maximum number of pieces of land you will get by choosing the points on the boundary carefully?
INPUT:
     The first line of the input file contains one integer s (0 < s < 3, 500), which indicates 
     how many input instances there are. The next s lines describe s input instances, each consisting 
     of exactly one integer n (0<=n<=2^31)
OUTPUT:
     For each input instance output the maximum possible number pieces of land defined by n points, 
     each printed on its own line.
